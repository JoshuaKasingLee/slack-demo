Extra Features:

BLOCKING FEATURE:

Send '/block <handle>' to block.
Send '/unblock <handle>' to unblock.

This feature allows a user to block another user. The messages of the blocked user will not appear for the user that blocked them ie. the contents of the blocked user's messages will be hidden. The user who did the blocking can still see that the user sent them a message, but not the contents. Unblocking the user will make messages visible again. This is an important feature as it allows people to block users if they feel their safety is being compramised or the user is making them uncomfortable.



HANGMAN FEATURE:

Send '/hangman' to begin hangman.
Send '/guess <letter>' to guess a letter.

Hangman generates a random word for the other members in the chat to guess. Users guess letter. The game is won when all letters are guessed.
This is an important feature as it allows users to have a bit of fun in between hard hours of work.
